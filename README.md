# What did I learn

1. Adopt SwiftLint to increse code quality to 95%, readability, easy to maintain by following Swift convention.
1. Core Data Framework to save notes at local storage (Create,Delete,Update,Retrieve)
2. AVFoudation Framework to play sound from project file
3. Singleton pattern to make it shareable and accessible by any class
4. Delegate as communication pattern between classes 
5. Develop with MVC Architecture
6. Design Custom toolbar and tableview cell with .xib
7. Use constants files to store string, brand colors
8. Utilise extension to separate delegate method (Clean Code)
9. Made application adapt with different screen size with AutoLayout (iOS,iPadOS,macOS)
